#  Data Analysis & Engineering Projects

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of data projects demonstrating my skills in **data analysis**, **data engineering fundamentals**, and **data-driven problem solving**. Each project focuses on transforming raw data into meaningful insights using industry-standard tools and workflows.

My goal with this repository is to showcase not just technical ability, but also **analytical thinking**, **clean data practices**, and the ability to answer real-world business questions.
